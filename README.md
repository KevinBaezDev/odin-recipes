# odin-recipes
The Odin Project has requested that I make a basic recipe website.
The curriculum has solely been HTML up to this point, there will be no css or js. The focus will be to practice what I have learned so far;
- HTML Boilerplate
- Certain tags (<a>, <img>, etc)
- Formatting (<p>, <ul>, <ol>)
